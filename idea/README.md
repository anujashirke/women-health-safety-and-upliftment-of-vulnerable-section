Women Safety and health
---------------------
Our project is concerned about women's health and safety. As a part of society, we are trying to provide a solution for their health and also highlighting how women's safety matters with the help of visualization. As a part of the solution, we are serving an application which will help to predict the chances of stroke and helplines for VAW (Violence Against Women)

women safety matters 
---------------------
Woman's harassment cause physical as well as psychological harm and it discourages women from participating in many cultural and social issues. 
By doing so, it hammers gender equality and valid general woman's rights.
It was also that in the COVID-19 situation one out of two women is facing violence.

analysis of women's safety
-------------------------
Data contains 16.15K women. Out of that, 28% of women face sexual abuse, 39% of women face verbal abuse, and 26% of women face physical abuse. 
We can see that Percentage of abuse is high in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Nigeria. 
When it comes to the Woman harassed by a spouse or partner, it is not only limited to that because a woman is also harassed or abused by their family member.
Ukraine contains the maximum percentage where a woman is harassed or abused by a family member.
These are the top 10 content countries where women are harassed by their family members.
When it comes to women's safety women not only feel unsafe during the day or the night, but they are also feeling unsafe at home.

action against women's harassment
-------------------------------
We can see information about women who asked for help.
we can see, it is observed that 6100 women are abused sexually in just six month period which is from April to September 2021.
we can see, that the number of calls asking for help is maximum in Bangladesh followed by Nigeria and Kenya.
6100 women are harassed sexually, but the woman who asked for help is just 5034.
The resources used by women for help are presented through pie-chart visualization.
we can see, that a maximum of the woman refers to go police or call the police for help, whereas women use the women's center very less for help.

narrative
----------
It's a storytelling of our entire dashboard. 
This will give all the statistics on safety and harassment.
Apart from that, we can also see the top five countries where women are harassed by family members and by their partners. 
So, we can see there are common countries over there.
As a solution for this, we are providing a helpline number and a link to the helpline page.

helpline
---------
This will give you the information about the helpline number available for a respective country, as well as the link which is available for them.
There are some buttons provided on it. Every button will take you to the new page.
The first button will tell about how to prevent violence against women.
The second button will tell about how to help a woman who is facing violence.	
the third button will tell about the woman who is working in several regions.

The study found that 12% more likely among a woman who experiences sexual harassment and 6% more common among the those who have a history 
of sexual assault are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke.
As a solution to that, we are building a website "स्त्री SVASTH".
